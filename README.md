## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a recent master's graduate who is deeply passionate about DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Infrastructure Automation.

I spent this time productively — self-learning, building projects, and gaining hands-on experience with industry tools like:

- 🐧 **Linux**
- 🐳 **Docker**
- ⚙️ **Jenkins**
- ☁️ **AWS**
- 📂 **Git & GitHub**
- 🛠️ **Shell Scripting**
- 📦 **CI/CD Concepts**

I'm now looking to apply my knowledge in a real-world DevOps role and grow through continuous learning and team collaboration.
